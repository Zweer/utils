# coverage-badge-readme

A simple CLI tool to automatically read your test coverage summary and inject an up-to-date [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) badge into your `README.md`.

Never manually update your coverage percentage again!

## Why?

Keeping the coverage badge in your README synchronized with your latest test run can be a manual and error-prone task. This tool automates the process by reading the `coverage-summary.json` file generated by popular testing frameworks and updating a placeholder in your README.

## Prerequisites

Your testing framework must be configured to generate a coverage summary report in `json-summary` format.

For **Jest**, **Vitest**, or **Istanbul/nyc**, add `json-summary` to your `coverageReporters` configuration.

Example for `jest.config.js` or `vite.config.ts`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  coverageReporters: ['json-summary', 'text', 'lcov'],
}
```

This will generate the required `coverage/coverage-summary.json` file when you run your tests with the `--coverage` flag.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @zweer/coverage-badge-readme
```

Or use it directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx @zweer/coverage-badge-readme --help
```

## Usage

1. Add your template badge in the README.md file:

   ```markdown
   ![Coverage Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-100%25-brightgreen?style=flat)
   ```

2. Run the CLI command after your tests have completed:

   ```bash
   npx coverage-badge-readme
   ```

Your `README.md` will be automatically updated with the current coverage percentage.

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
